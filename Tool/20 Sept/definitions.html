					The meaning of a number of specific terms will usually need to be laid out in detail to ensure common understandings amongst the parties. The language used should be accessible to researchers and those parties that will implement elements of the MTA. This is important because these parties are bound by terms that they may not be involved in negotiating or drafting but understanding their implications is nonetheless important. <br> <br>Whether these terms will need to be included in the MTA and defined is completely dependent on the terms of the agreement, but might include: <br><br>
