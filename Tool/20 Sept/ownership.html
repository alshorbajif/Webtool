					Ownership of samples / materials and custodianship
				</h3>
				<p>
					Recent consultations on MTAs for use in public health emergencies heard that different stakeholders held incompatible views as to who owned samples and associated data, or whether ownership, rather than guardianship, was the most appropriate framing of this issue. It has been suggested that the MTA tool should not be too specific on issues of ownership – where necessary, the tool should reflect the divergence of opinion on this issue, bearing in mind different contexts, legal regimes and scenarios.<br><br>One approach that can help address these concerns is to address the acquisition of rights or title by the recipient over the samples and associated data transferred. This sidesteps the issue as to who owns the samples.<br>

					<br>Failing to address the ownership of any results can cause confusion as to what can be done with them. Would a laboratory receiving samples and associated data primarily for diagnostic purposes be able to aggregate and anonymise the data generated and use it in part of a publication? Such papers have been traditional outputs from recipient laboratories following their involvement in addressing a public health emergency. They are seen by some as a quid pro quo for their involvement. Careful&nbsp;<a href="definitions.html">definition</a>&nbsp;of ‘results&rsquo; and ‘purpose&rsquo; might be necessary to explicitly capture permission and in what way the contribution of those supplying the sample and associated data should be reflected. This may also be connected to a publication section in an MTA. <br> <br>As a result, some MTAs explicitly state that any results produced are owned by those that generate them (i.e. the recipient).
