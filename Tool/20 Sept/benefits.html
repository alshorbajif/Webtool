					When considering benefit sharing, it will be important to take into account the importance of data sharing during public health emergencies.<br><br>There may be practical challenges to addressing benefit sharing issues within the MTA itself, especially during the early stages of a public health emergency. For example, during the public consultation on this tool, it was suggested that “it will likely be government representatives who are signing agreements to transfer materials. Governments will likely be unable – and unwilling – to negotiate commercial terms that apply to future, potentially unknown, commercial actors. As a result, detailed benefit sharing terms may need to be negotiated at a later date when the specific partners, uses and expected benefits can be better defined.”<br><br>It was also suggested that “It is also potentially difficult to pre-negotiate benefits with commercial partners. Unlike the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework regarding influenza viruses with pandemic potential, there is no overarching arrangement governing access to samples of other infectious diseases. There may not be researchers or manufacturers working with the relevant pathogen with which to negotiate, or any established marketplace for countermeasures that can be used to inform the value of any potential benefits. As a result, even if potential manufacturers are identified and engaged in the negotiations, they&rsquo;re unlikely to have a good understanding of their chances of success in developing a countermeasure, their capacity to produce such a product, what the value of that product might be, etc..”<br><br>Discussions of issues around ‘access on preferential terms&rsquo; have occurred repeatedly in the context of MTAs. Some feel that any form of preferential access comes at a cost to others and possibly to the efficacy of the broader public health response. As a result they have called for a multilateral approach. Others have called into question the utility or feasibility of on overarching agreement.<br><br>There is also no universal understanding as to the meaning of key terms. Access, for example, is connected to affordability, research input, research outputs, and product development. Access might mean lower prices for countermeasures developed using a sample and associated data. It can also be connected with fewer intellectual property barriers to generate more innovation, and greater product possibilities. Access issues are therefore intertwined with the intellectual property issues.<br><br>Challenges in identifying in advance the most effective forms of benefit sharing have also been raised. For example, during the public consultation on the tool it was suggested that “in the early days of an outbreak, it may be premature to commit to providing a specific country with priority access to countermeasures when, depending on the dynamics of the outbreak, the most appropriate/effective global public health response strategy to an emerging disease may require deploying countermeasures elsewhere.”<br>
