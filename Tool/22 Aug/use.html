					Prioritizing the use of samples and associated data
				</h3>
				<p>
					Samples from a public health emergency can be a valuable resource in improving our understanding of the diseases involved and in developing tools and technologies for use in future outbreaks. There are often also only limited amounts of samples available for such work. There will be many uses to which these samples might be put but given their finite nature, some system of prioritizing work may be necessary. Consideration may need to be given to who can decide upon the ‘best&rsquo; use of available samples and associated materials and how to ensure an appropriate role for the communities and governments providing the samples and associated data.<br><br>In some cases, there may be coordinated, international efforts to structure this discussion. For example, during the EVD PHEIC in West Africa WHO convened the Ebola Science Committee which brought together expertise in virology, epidemiology, clinical and behavioural science, mathematical modelling, and science and public health policy, and worked with the Ministries of Health from particularly affected countries and representatives from survivor networks to produce a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/WHO_ebola-science-committee-research-agenda.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank">prioritized research agenda</a>&nbsp; This focused on ‘basic&rsquo; as opposed to ‘applied&rsquo; research.<br><br>When considering the use or further use of samples and associated data to be covered by an MTA, it may be useful to refer or reference such research agendas. If no structured approach exists, it may be necessary for parties to an MTA to consider what types of work they consider to be the most important for the samples and associated data being transferred.<br>

					Potential for commercial development
				</h3>
				<p>
					While in emergencies it is admirable to want to share information and samples, if commercial entities are involved it is unclear how willing they might be to do so.<br><br>During the development of this tool, some have suggested that MTAs for use in emergencies may benefit from a non-commercial model – where the material is transferred for specific public health purposes, such as pathogen identification or characterization. Any subsequent commercial use, such as the development of vaccines and therapeutics, would require additional negotiation, possibly after the emergency is over. It was also noted that some institutions may be restricted by pre-existing commitments to funders or commercial partners on these issues. A suggestion received during the public consultation on this tool was to encourage the inclusion in future MTAs of a standard clause allowing material to be shared between associated parties in the case of a severe health emergency. Several participants have suggested that subsequent use other than for commercial development may be more broadly acceptable but it will still necessitate consideration of equitable benefit sharing and compliance with rules over the use of human tissues.<br><br>Others have suggested that it may not be useful to differentiate between commercial and non-commercial activities. Some of these concerns about differentiating between the two – noting that non-commercial research can rapidly become part of a commercial activity. Others have questioned the feasibility of excluding “commercialization” from initial consideration of an MTAs given recent experiences demonstrating the importance of the participation of commercial actors to develop and mass-produce diagnostics during the emergency period.<br><br>Differentiating between “commercial” and “research” uses of material may not be feasible in complex public-private product development systems such as those that commonly exist in the United States. For example, “research” conducted by a U.S. academic or government laboratory on a diagnostic product could later have “commercial” potential if licensed to a commercial actor to allow for mass production. In general, it should be determined whether “commercial” and “research” uses can be acceptably differentiated, and, if so, how the differences can be enforced in an MTA.<br>
