					Ownership of samples / materials and custodianship
				</h3>
				<p>
					Recent consultations on MTAs for use in public health emergencies heard that different stakeholders held incompatible views as to who owned samples and associated data, or whether ownership, rather than guardianship, was the most appropriate framing of this issue. It has been suggested that the MTA tool should not be too specific on issues of ownership – where necessary, the tool should reflect the divergence of opinion on this issue, bearing in mind different contexts, legal regimes and scenarios.<br><br>One approach that can help address these concerns is to address the acquisition of rights or title by the recipient over the samples and associated data transferred. Some MTAs explicitly state that the recipient gains no such rights. This effectively differentiates questions over ownership or rights connected to the samples and associated data from ownership or rights over any results, or derivatives produced using them.<br><br>There are important ownership questions around the results from the intended use. Some MTAs explicitly state that any results produced are owned by those that generate them (i.e. the recipient). In other cases, this issue is not addressed, posing possible confusion as to what can be done with the results generated. Would a laboratory receiving samples and associated data primarily for diagnostic purposes be able to aggregate and anonymise the data generated and use it in part of a publication? Such papers have been traditional outputs from recipient laboratories following their involvement in addressing a public health emergency. They are seen by some as a quid pro quo for their involvement. Careful definition of ‘results&rsquo; and ‘purpose&rsquo; might be necessary to explicitly capture permission and in what way the contribution of those supplying the sample and associated data should be reflected. This may also be connected to a publication section in an MTA.<br><br>There are also important considerations as to the ownership of any derivatives or data generated through the intended use. For example, some might argue that an isolated culture is sufficiently different from the original sample to have a different ownership. Equally, the resources produced during the intended purpose may be intangible, for example, genetic sequence data. Who would own this data? There may not be simple answers to these questions and there are being explored outside of a public health emergency. For example, the relationship between physical samples and the corresponding genome sequence data is being considered by an Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group under the Convention for Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol.<br><br>Past discussions have also highlighted that in order to ensure that the interests of individual providers of samples and associated data, and where relevant, donor communities, are given due weight in efforts to prepare relevant MTAs, it may be useful to consider:<br>

					During the development of the tool, it was suggested that whilst there may be confusion over the ownership of materials, this could actually support stronger benefit sharing requirements in favor of affected populations – ensuring that those most affected by the disease directly benefit from the use of any samples and associated data.
