					Purpose of this tool
				</h1>
				<p>
					WHO is constructing a tool to help build human capacity to develop material transfer agreements (MTAs) governing biological samples and associated data connected to severe emerging diseases with potential to generate a public health emergency, and for which no, or insufficient, preventive and curative solutions exist. The tool is intended for use prior to a public health emergency. It is part of broader efforts to build human capacity to manage sample sharing in a manner that ensures the full public health potential of valuable biological material is realized for rapid detection of, and response to public health emergencies.<br><br>The tool is intended to build the human capacity needed to develop and agree MTAs during a public health emergency for diagnostic and public health purposes, taking into account the full range of associated considerations. It will also help to build capacity that could be of use outside of an emergency, or subsequent discussions on further use of samples.<br>

				<p>
					During a public health emergency, transfers covered by MTAs will be important for a variety of important purposes, including the identification and characterization of the responsible pathogen, diagnostic purposes, clinical decision making, epidemiology, the development or validation of diagnostic tools as well as medical countermeasure development.

					The tool is not meant to be prescriptive, but rather it is meant to provide users with options and examples of proven solutions and language.<br><br>It is not intended to be used to develop an MTA during a public health emergency. There have been attempts to develop model MTAs for use in these circumstances. As one respondent to the public call for comments on this tool noted:<br>
				</p>
				<p class="text-left mg-md" data-placement="left" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is a tooltip">
					“The tool presents users with an overly broad menu of terms that could be combined to create a large number of unique MTAs. Combining complex terms in novel ways will require time-consuming negotiations, which our prior experience has shown can delay detection or early identification of a potential emergency. While the menu-based approach may offer value outside of a potential or actual public health emergency, the tool simply contains unnecessary information to facilitate the timely sharing of samples.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The tool will be accessible to different types of user, including those in health ministries, laboratories or other relevant facilities, as well as those generating samples in the field. It will help users with different levels of experience, from those with little previous exposure to MTAs, through to experts looking for concrete examples of text. The tool will help both those sending and receiving samples and associated data. It will cover the movement samples and associated data for a wide range of purposes, from diagnosis, through to countermeasure research and development.

					Efforts to build capacity around sample access, sharing and use complement existing WHO work on&nbsp;<a class="ltc-aqua" href="http://www.who.int/blueprint/what/norms-standards/en/" target="_blank">data sharing during public health emergencies</a>&nbsp; This tool is intended to focus on physical samples and directly associated data (metadata) – such as where, when and by whom it was taken. It might also encompass clinical information intended to accompany the samples (such as the disease state of the donor). It could usefully link to other data being gathered or used for epidemiological purposes. It is not intended to cover stand-alone data, such as genome sequence data (other than as a derivative of the sample) which would covered by efforts to consider data sharing during public health emergencies, which already advocate that that such information is disseminated rapidly and transparently.
